    "My test of the two imbalance techniques has given me a very clear, though problematic, result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Main Problem:** My advanced models (Random Forest, SVM) are completely ignoring the imbalance techniques. They still show high 95% accuracy, but their Recall (Fatal) is 0.0. This means they are 100% useless for my project's goal, as they are simply predicting \"Non-Fatal\" every time to get a high score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Only Model That Responded: Logistic Regression was the only model that actually tried to learn the 'Fatal' class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The New \"Best\" Model: My new \"best\" model is Logistic Regression (SMOTE). This is not because of its terrible 52.6% accuracy, but because it was the only model to achieve a significant Recall (Fatal) of 44.7%. This means it successfully found 89 of the 199 fatal accidents in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The New Problem (Low Precision): However, this model's Precision (Fatal) is extremely low (4.7%). This tells me that to find those 89 fatal accidents, it incorrectly flagged a huge number of non-fatal accidents as 'Fatal', which is what destroyed its overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "My conclusion is that I have a classic Precision-Recall trade-off. I have a model that can find fatal accidents (high recall) but is \"crying wolf\" constantly (low precision). My baseline models are the opposite: they never cry wolf (high precision) but also never find a fatal accident (zero recall)."

    "My test using XGBoost with the scale_pos_weight parameter was unsuccessful in creating a useful model for predicting fatal accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Accuracy, Low Value:** The model achieved 90.3% accuracy, which is much higher than the SMOTE/SMOTEENN Logistic Regression models. However, this is still misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall Failure:** The critical metric, Recall (Fatal), is extremely low at 5.0%. This means the model only correctly identified 10 out of the 199 fatal accidents in the test set. It missed 189 (FN (Fatal)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision Failure:** The Precision (Fatal) is also very low at 4.8%. When the model did predict 'Fatal', it was wrong most of the time (199 FP (Fatal) vs. only 10 TP (Fatal)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low F1-Score:** Consequently, the F1-Score (Fatal) is only 4.9%, indicating a very poor balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for New Task 2**\n",
    "My conclusion is that simply adjusting the class weight using scale_pos_weight was not enough to force the XGBoost model to effectively learn the patterns of the rare 'Fatal' class in this dataset. It performed better than the Random Forest but significantly worse than the SMOTE-based Logistic Regression in terms of actually finding fatal accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems the default 50% decision threshold is inappropriate for all my models."

    "My attempt to find an optimal threshold using the Precision-Recall curve has dramatically shifted the model's behavior, but it has still failed to produce a usable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfect Recall Achieved:** By setting the decision threshold extremely low (0.0007 or 0.07%), the model successfully achieved 100% Recall (Fatal). It found all 199 fatal accidents in the test set (TP (Fatal) = 199, FN (Fatal) = 0). This is a significant improvement over the previous attempts where recall was the main issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision Collapsed:** However, this perfect recall came at the cost of catastrophic precision. The Precision (Fatal) is only 5.0%. To find those 199 fatal accidents, the model incorrectly flagged 3799 non-fatal accidents as fatal (FP (Fatal)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Destroyed:** As a result of the massive number of false positives, the overall Accuracy plummeted to 5.4%. The model is essentially predicting \"Fatal\" almost all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low F1-Score:** The F1-Score (Fatal) is 9.5%. While this is the highest F1-Score I've achieved so far (compared to 8.6% for LR-SMOTE and 4.9% for default XGBoost), it is still extremely low, indicating a severe imbalance between precision and recall.\n",

    "**Conclusion for New Task 3 & Advanced Phase 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My conclusion remains the same, but now with even stronger evidence: this dataset cannot be used to reliably predict fatal accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advanced techniques (SMOTEENN, XGBoost scale_pos_weight, Threshold Tuning) successfully demonstrated that I can force a model to find the rare 'Fatal' class (achieving high Recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the cost of doing so is an unacceptably high number of false positives, leading to terrible Precision and F1-Scores.\n",

    "# Phase 4 Conclusion: Predictive Modeling Limitations\n",
    "My primary objective in Phase 4 was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting accident severity, specifically distinguishing between 'Fatal' and 'Non-Fatal' outcomes, aiming for an accuracy of at least 85%. However, my comprehensive attempts revealed significant limitations inherent in the dataset for this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Models & The Accuracy Paradox**\n",
    "My baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) initially showed promising accuracy scores around 95%. However, a deeper analysis revealed this was an \"Accuracy Paradox\" caused by severe class imbalance. The 'Fatal' class represented only about 5% of the data. The models achieved high accuracy simply by predicting the majority 'Non-Fatal' class every time, resulting in a Recall and F1-Score of 0.0 for 'Fatal' accidents. These models were completely unable to identify the critical events they were designed to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attempts to Address Class Imbalance**\n",
    "Recognizing the imbalance, I implemented several advanced techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Weighting & SMOTE:** Using class_weight='balanced' and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with Logistic Regression did improve Recall (Fatal) to approximately 44.7%. However, this came at the cost of extremely low Precision (Fatal) (around 4.7%) and overall accuracy (~53%). The models incorrectly flagged a vast number of non-fatal accidents as fatal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SMOTEENN:** The hybrid SMOTEENN technique performed slightly worse than SMOTE alone, yielding a Recall (Fatal) of 43.7% and a Precision (Fatal) of 4.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost with scale_pos_weight:** Directly weighting the classes within the powerful XGBoost algorithm failed to produce meaningful recall, achieving only 5% Recall (Fatal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threshold Tuning:** My final attempt involved tuning the decision threshold of the XGBoost model using a Precision-Recall curve. While this successfully achieved 100% Recall (Fatal), the Precision (Fatal) dropped to 5.0%, and the overall accuracy collapsed to 5.4%. The model essentially predicted 'Fatal' for almost every instance to maximize recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Prediction Targets**\n",
    "Attempts to predict alternative, potentially less imbalanced targets also failed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**'Serious' vs 'Minor':** This failed because the dataset, after filtering, contained only one of these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**'Accident Reason':** A multi-class model predicting the top accident reasons performed very poorly, achieving only 24% accuracy, barely better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Conclusion for Phase 4\n",
    "My rigorous testing and application of multiple techniques lead to a clear conclusion: the available features in this dataset are insufficient to reliably predict accident severity, particularly rare fatal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I could force models to achieve high recall for fatal accidents, it always resulted in an unacceptably high rate of false positives, rendering the models impractical for real-world use. The features (time, location, weather, road conditions, vehicle type, daily aggregates) lack the necessary granularity and specificity (like speed at impact, seatbelt usage, angle of collision, driver condition) to distinguish the factors that lead to a fatality versus a serious or minor injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a critical finding of the project. It demonstrates the limitations of the data itself, not necessarily a failure of the modeling techniques. While the dataset proved excellent for the descriptive and diagnostic analysis conducted in Phase 3 (identifying hotspots and patterns), it is not suitable for predictive modeling of severity. Future predictive efforts would require a significantly richer dataset."
